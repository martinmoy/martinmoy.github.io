Made a CLI gem to scrape https://www.lineups.com/ for nba rosters. Scraping was the most difficult part of this project. There were alot of trial and error in trying to scrape correctly. Overall, the project was pretty fun.  Steve Jobs once said 
“Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.” This clearly applies to the object relationship between the classes.
